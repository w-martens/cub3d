# s0me funny stuff
- wasd move
- left n right arrows (maybe q & e) let u skew the world by making camera plane not perpendicular
- up n down change FOV
- start out w black textures for walls, only sprites visible.
- space screenshots and places screenshot as textures on walls and floors
- shift resets skew and fov, would b cool if that could happen fluently
- player model is not holding a gun but a camera that has a cool flash animation
- walls blink while with the camera flash animated when changing texture


### if u could even like do 
's0me thing'
- if music is a possibility, enter ost from first flash, before that ambient sound is heard
- progression could require you to take photos of certain objects and bring them to characters
- enable the ability to include/exclude character model in screenshot by praying to a holy statue while holy music plays
